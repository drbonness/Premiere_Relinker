# Function: Write the names of all the files (with a certain file type) in a directory, ordered by modification date, to a csv
# Purpose: The modification date of footage should not change when it is renamed. This program should give the original order of footage files after they have been renamed. Use this program in conjunction with the Premiere file relinker program.
